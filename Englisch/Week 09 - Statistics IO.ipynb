With queries like this one every ninja will be surprised sooner or later and this proves that the other users have certain ninja skills, too, because you are certainly never prepared for this situation. So what to do? Of course we'll see what the query does. First search for victims in the Execution Plan, but how much data is read at all? The Katana that decomposes this question is STATISTICS IO.  \r\n",
