                "Occasionally you may want to create an empty table to store the data from a query. Of course, you can now check the metadata of all columns in the query from all source tables and write a DDL statement. But this can be quite complicated with queries with multiple joins and possibly manipulations in the columns. If you want to copy data into a new table you can do this with `SELECT INTO`. If you only want to copy the structure instead, you can simply copy the `TOP 0` rows, i.e. no rows, which will give you a table that only reflects the structure of the source statement. \r\n",
