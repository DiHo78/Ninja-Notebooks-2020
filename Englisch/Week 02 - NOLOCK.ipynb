                "### What's NOLOCK?\r\n",
                "`NOLOCK` is a so called query hint that allows you to override or change the default SQL Server behavior for your query. `NOLOCK` is a hint that overrides the isolation level for the corresponding query. This works for read-only queries, so you cannot use the `NOLOCK` hint in `UPDATE`,  `DELETE` or `INSERT` statements. The `NOLOCK` hint is synonymous with the `READUNCOMMITED` hint, so it changes the isolation level of your query to allow dirty reads, so the query can return data that will not end up in the table at all when a `ROLLBACK` occurs.\r\n",
                "### Use of NOLOCK\r\n",
                "There are some myths surrounding `NOLOCK`, but at the same time it is probably the most commonly used query hint in the SQL Server universe. The following queries explain the effects and use of `NOLOCK` in more detail. In order to understand these queries, you will usually have to work with two sessions simultaneously, so you will need several open query tabs in your Azure Data Studio or SSMS or other query tool of your choice. \r\n",

                "This is not quite true. Of course, queries that run with `NOLOCK` do not need to put data into the transaction log and therefore require less memory and are faster. However, there is little point in changing the isolation level for each query at the query level, because on the one hand you will get results like `UNCOMMITED READS' that are not provided by the DBA (otherwise the database would have a different global isolation level).\r\n",
