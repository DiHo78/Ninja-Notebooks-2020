                "The `DENSE_RANK` function is, as the name suggests, closely related to the `RANK` function from last week. So what is the difference? It's relatively simple: while the `RANK` function skips a number when assigning the same number for two lines, the `DENSE_RANK` function skips nothing, so here you get a continuous sequence of numbers. \r\n",
                "## How can you work with DENSE_RANK?\r\n",
                "Remember the query we used last week using the `RANK` function. We created a query in the Wide World Importers database that returns sortable items, but the sorting does not have to be unique. We used a CTE to count the number of orders in which each product appeared in the OrderLines and calculated the popularity of the respective product with the `RANK` function: "
