                "In the last two weeks you had learned about the `WHILE` statement in the Dojo and used it to delete batches of lines. We had given you the warning that the SQL Server (like almost every relational database engine) is primarily designed to operate with data sets, i.e. with multiple rows. But what if you really need to process individual rows in a result set for some reason? Some of our `WHILE` constructs have already done just that, and some of you will have flinched and instinctively closed the page. If that's you, you can do that for this week, because today we'll be covering `CURSOR`. A `CURSOR` can be thought of as a pointer pointing to the first row of the result set, which you can always jump to the next row. \r\n",

                "## How can you work with CURSORs?\r\n",
                "To define a cursor, you must first define a variable that holds the line. You do this by declaring a variable that is your `SELECT` statement as type `CURSOR FOR`. So let's first write a statement that gives us a result set that we can iterate on. For example, let's take the set of databases on our server: "
