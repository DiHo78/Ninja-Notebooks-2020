                "Like the `ROW_NUMBER` function introduced last week, `RANK` is also a window function, i.e. a function that processes the data sorted in so-called \"windows\" or \"partitions\". You define the sorting and the partitions by using the keywords `ORDER BY` and `PARTITION BY` after the function call. The `RANK` function then numbers all the rows in the result set, starting at 1 in ascending order. Unlike the `ROW_NUMBER` function, the `RANK` function numbers rows that are in the same position in the sort with the same number. With `ROW_NUMBER`, a random sort is chosen here and numbered uniquely sequentially.  \r\n",
                "## How can you work with RANK?\r\n",
                "To use the `RANK` function, we now create a query in the Wide World Importers database that returns sortable items, but where the sort need not be unique. For this we use a CTE to count the number of orders from the OrderLines in which each product appeared: "
