                "Last week you got to know `STATISTICS IO`, a tool that tells you how much data a query needs to read from disk to answer a query. How does `STATISTICS TIME` differ from `STATISTICS IO`? While `STATISTICS IO` logs disk accesses, `STATISTICS TIME` returns the CPU time required for a query. That is, the time that was used to read and understand the query and to find an execution plan for the query on the one hand, and the time that the CPU was busy calculating values during the execution of the query, for example. \r\n",
                "## How can you work with STATISTICS TIME?\r\n",
                "If you want to see how many disk accesses a query causes, you can get this information by sending a 'SET STATISTICS TIME ON' before the query. What you will then see is a set of information that we will examine a bit more closely below. \r\n",
