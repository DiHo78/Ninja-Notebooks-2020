                "`OUTER APPLY` is a means of first formulating subqueries, which are executed for each line in the result, and is then joined to the result. This is, of course, a means to be used with extreme caution, because since an `OUTER APPLY` is executed for every row in the result, even a cheap (sub-)query here can lead to high overall query costs.\r\n",
                "## How can you use OUTER APPLY?\r\n",
                "Imagine that you want to know in the Wide World Importers database for every item in stock when it was last ordered. If you would now join the items with the orders, you would have a huge result set, where you get every order for every item. From these you would then have to pick the last ones. Thereby you would work with a much larger amount of data than you actually want. This means that you would need more memory, more temp DB and more CPU time to process the query than the actual amount of data justifies. \r\n",
                "If you want to avoid this, you can use `OUTER APPLY` to execute a subquery for each line that completes this value. The whole thing will look like this:"
