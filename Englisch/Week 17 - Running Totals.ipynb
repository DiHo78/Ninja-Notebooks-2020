                "A Running Total is a scenario in which each row contains the sum of the values of a specific column of the previous rows. A good example of this is when points from different games are added up. Of course, it is important for a running total that the rows are run through in an unambiguous sorting, otherwise any values will come up in our calculation.  \r\n",
                "## How can you calculate a Running Total?\r\n",
                "A running total is similar to the `RANK` and `ROW_NUMBER` functions already discussed. It is a window function, i.e. a function that operates on a certain set of rows and combines them. \r\n",
