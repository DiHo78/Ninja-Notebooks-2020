                "Now, you've heard many times in the Dojo that SQL is always effective when operating on records, and that SQL is a language that allows set operations. That's why the possibilities for flow control in SQL are rather sparse compared to other programming languages, some of which you have already got to know here. But what about function calls? How can you react when a line is inserted into a table? The answer to these questions is `TRIGGER`.  \r\n",
                "## What can you use TRIGGER for?\r\n",
                "Most of you probably know `TRIGGER` as a construct that takes effect whenever a record is inserted, modified or deleted. There are also `TRIGGER` constructs that are used when objects are created, modified, or deleted in databases. There are also `LOGIN TRIGGERS`. \r\n",
                "But what does 'take effect' mean? Often - in analogy to the trigger as a trigger of a firearm - it is also called 'firing'. To understand, what exactly is meant by this, we first create a `TRIGGER`. First we need two tables, one on which we define the trigger and one in which we write data when the trigger \"fires\". For these tables we create our own schema: "
